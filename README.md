I created a pathology image classification web app. The model was trained on Teachable Machine. Currently, the model can detect 3 classes: High squamous intra-epithelial lesion, Low squamous intra-epithelial lesion, and Negative for Intraepithelial malignancy. The webapp was created and deployed on Streamlit https://digitalpathology.streamlit.app/. This work is based on the Youtube tutorial: Pneumonia classification web app with Python and Streamlit https://youtu.be/n_eMARPqBZI?si=hLtDXZzkSz0qTKoA!
